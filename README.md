 ESM Arduino Tasks

This repository contains three Arduino tasks implemented using TinkerCAD as part of the ESM assignment.

Tasks

1. LED Brightness Control using Potentiometer
   Folder: `led-brightness`  
   - Controls the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer and PWM.

2. RGB LED Control using Potentiometers
   Folder: `rgb-led`  
   - Controls the Red, Green, and Blue intensities of an RGB LED using potentiometers.

3. LCD 16×2 Display using Arduino (I2C)
   Folder: `lcd-display`  
   - Displays text on a 16×2 LCD using I2C communication.

Each task folder contains:
- A `README.md` explaining the logic
- Arduino source code
- Circuit screenshot from TinkerCAD
